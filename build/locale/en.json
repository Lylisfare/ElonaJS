{"classes":{"archer":{"name":"Archer","description":"The Archer. Skilled in the ways of the forest and hunting, they are master marksmen, and don't see why one should hunt monster any different than a deer. Skilled with the Short Sword, the axe, and of course all types of bows, plus a few skills they picked up on their long trips in the woods. Firm believers that \"Anything dead over THERE will not be bothering me HERE\"."},"claymore":{"name":"Claymore","description":"The Claymore. Half-human, with silver eyes and inhuman evasive capabilities, the Claymores are a mostly female class, as the males have problems. Their weapon of choice is the Claymore, hence their name, and they prefer light armor, relying on their great speed and skills of evasion to protect them. They heal fast, but the healing comes at a price. Their bodies are unstable, their motto unknown."},"farmer":{"name":"Farmer","description":"The Farmer. While not a steely-thewed Warrior or or well read Mage, the farmer is a Jack-of All-Trades. Good with a polearm from threshing grain, and good bargainers with their deals with merchants, they have working knowledge of just about every trade there is. As such, they never go hungry, as there's always something someone will pay dearly to get done. Their motto: \"Anything worth doing is best done yourself\"."},"gunner":{"name":"Gunner","description":""},"pianist":{"name":"Pianist","description":"The Pianist. Where the Farmer has all the practical skills, the Pianist has all the impractical ones. Still, they can read a book, play a tune, make jewelry, and since they are expected to haul a piano around, they get real good with weight lifting. Their Motto: \"The whole world is my stage!\" And they believe it too."},"predator":{"name":"Predator","description":""},"priest":{"name":"Priest","description":"The Priest. The Faithful, the devout. They bring the words of their God to the world, one battered heretic at a time. Good with all armors, shields, divine magic, blunt weapons, and reading. The Priest is a handful, though depending on their God, they may have hidden pratfalls as well. If the motto: \"A hymn a day,, will keep me away, Sinner!\" appeals to you, choose this."},"thief":{"name":"Thief","description":"The Thief. Good with swords and bows, though not a believer of a fair fight. Prefers to avoid taking hits if possible. Can dual wield if the weapons aren't too heavy. Years of dealing with fences have given the Thief skills with negotiating a better deal. A firm believer in the adage \"What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine. See that guy over there, his stuff? Mine too.\""},"tourist":{"name":"Tourist","description":"The Tourist. They have no strengths, they have no weaknesses. They don't have anything really. Oh they can fish, I'll give you that, but if you want a real challenge to build something from the ground up, this is the way to go. After all, you have to teach them everything. Only for those who have a good amount of time to spare. You can even write your own motto if you want."},"warmage":{"name":"Warmage","description":"The Warmage. Not really a Wizard, not really a Warrior, the Warmage is a believer that stabbing things that are on fire is better than just stabbing them or setting them on fire. Good with swords, armor, books and casting. Their only weakness is that without specialization, they won't truely excel in a field. Still when your motto is: \"Everything worth doing is worth overdoing\", you don't really care."},"warrior":{"name":"Warrior","description":"The Warrior. With working knowledge of all things stabby, bashy, choppy, and shooty, anything in a Warrior's hands is bad news for their enemies. No mere thug, they have knowledge of tactics to bring even the strongest down, and are trained early on to be comfortable in all kinds of armor and shields. Warriors are personifications of the adage \"If violence isn't working, you are obviously not using enough of it.\""},"wizard":{"name":"Wizard","description":"The Wizard. Master of the Arcane, the Eldritch, and the Esoteric. A pity all those years have left little time to build muscles or quick reflexes. Still, they do have some small skill with staff and short sword. And while they start out so feeble Purits scare them, with a few books under their belt, and a little practice, a Wizard will soon decimate legions.

I have no intention of harming you. I simply wish for a conversational partner. Someone to talk to about myself.","dialogue_2":"Someone to talk to? Don't expect for us to reach some sort of understanding. You're slyly manipulating the public opinion in order to call for the destruction of the Vindale Forest. Until you can provide some evidence that the issue of the Forest and the Ether Winds are the cause of the calamity of which you speak, the Elea will never believe you.","dialogue_3":"There's no need for you to believe me. In fact, my story is a lie. Rather than being the cause of the calamity, the Vindale Forest is an antidote of sorts. It senses the revival of the Meshera and is releasing an antibody which we know as Ether.","dialogue_4":"...What are you saying?","dialogue_5":"Fufu, got your attention now do I? But I'm afraid you'll have to listen to my tale before I inform you of the truth of the Forest.","dialogue_6":"...","dialogue_7":"This story is from long ago. There were once two princes in Zanan. One was a frail and ugly albino, while the other was his handsome and vigorous brother Clyne. The name of the first, I think, need not be mentioned. The two princes were as different as light and shadow. The warlike Clyne was naturally successful, while his brother who lived in his shadow was a failure.","dialogue_8":"Unlike his brother, the younger boy despised conflict, instead preferring song and poem. He was a pacifist and did much to help the disadvantaged and those that were orphaned by the war. Among these, he took a particular interest in the ' Heretical' Elea and their Forest. While Clyne amused himself with hunting and socializing, the younger boy devoted himself to studying the Forest. Hope, after all, is something born of ignorance. Perhaps it was that he saw something of himself in the Heretical Forest. By eliminating the prejudice and suspicion regarding the Forest, and by exploring a path of coexistance with the Elea, he believed the world might change...","dialogue_9":"And yet years passed while his research made little progress. Fufu, the boy simply could not come to terms with the life of an adult. He couldn't accept that the world was at its core an unkind and unfair place where the strong rule over the weak. He began to begrudge his brother who continuously rose in power, all the while cursing himself for being born an albino and hating the world that refused to change its ways... And then, he met an angel.","dialogue_10":"She was an Elean girl roughly his own age. From the moment he saw her he was fascinated with her. Her chestnut eyes were strong, gentle, and overflowing with compassion. As he watched her live a strong life in Zanan which is notoriously cruel to her kind, he once again saw a part of himself in the Elea.","dialogue_11":"For the boy, she was... No, I think that's a story for another time... Suffice it to say that her passing left nothing but a gaping wound upon the boy's heart. Even now I am pained by my memories of that time... Let's continue this later. There is more than enough time to discuss everything.","actor_1":"<Saimore> The Crown Prince of Zanan","actor_2":"<Barius> The Blue Haired","actor_3":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind"},"act1_9":{"narration_1":"Meanwhile, in the bar in Derphy.","dialogue_1":"Hoh, so you came without your subordinates. Don't expect me to forget that you're our 'lifeline' with Zanan though.","dialogue_2":"Zanan itself has nothing to do with all of this. The girl's confinement is a direct order from Saimore. From what I understand though, he's ready to release her at any time.","dialogue_3":"And what does Saimore want in return?","dialogue_4":"Very soon the leaders from various countries will be gathering in Palmia for discussion. His request is that she attend as a representative of the Elea.","dialogue_5":"...That's it? That kind of opportunity is something we've been desperately hoping for. What would he stand to gain from this?","dialogue_6":"If his intent was simply to arrest you all, there were innumberable methods he could have chosen. I'm sure Saimore has some twisted event planned... something he'll find humorous.","actor_1":"<Sevilis> The Fog of Derphy","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind","actor_3":"<Lomias> The Messenger From Vindale","actor_4":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_5":"Sevilis' Subordinate","actor_6":"<Barius> The Blue Haired"},"act1_10":{"narration_1":"Meanwhile, in Saimore's camp.","dialogue_1":"I'm sure you've heard about the funeral of the late Prince Clyne, yes? Twas a grand affair, after all. Yet, few people are aware that there was no corpse within his coffin. The world was told that Clyne's death was a result of falling off a cliff while out on a ride... But that's not the truth. Would you care to take a guess at what is? Clyne was murdered. Murdered by that albino boy that everyone despised.","dialogue_2":"As Clyne took in the view from the mountainside, his brother pushed him off the cliff. And when he made that push, something within himself died as well. Having struggled his entire life to not be a burden on others, it was the first time the boy felt powerful and free. And yet in that moment, in his lust to deny and overturn the values of his brother whom the world viewed as a success, he abandoned himself. His pacifism, his compassion for the poor, his affection for the weak, all of the morals he touted - he betrayed them all and became nothing more than a tool for the power he had despised all his life.","dialogue_3":"And even after becoming the successor to Zanan, he was unable to move forward. Oh, he could exercise his power and become a second Clyne if he so wished. But could he truly deny everything he once was? His past self that was so ugly and weak? Could he honestly turn his head, pretending that the pain and conflict that he and others had experienced each and every day did not exist? It was the very means by which I affimed myself that also took away my ability to accept the world. Morals, values, emotions... What had I left to believe in? But don't misunderstand. I am not attempting to garner your sympathy by making it appear that I am unhappy or feel regret.","dialogue_4":"Why tell me your story, then? To be honest, the choices you have defined for yourself appear as simple deception to me. Could that boy from the past who preached compassion towards the weak truly accept becoming such an ugly person as you are now? I won't say that I don't understand your pain. But having been rejected by the world - No, I should say having turned your back on it - and running from a life you felt incomplete, wishing nothing but pain and hatred upon yourself... I can't help but wonder if you're using this things to fill the emptiness in your heart.","dialogue_5":"You say you had nothing left to believe in, but I  feel that potential still lies within your heart. I think you have decided that some things are undeserving of love, and that you yourself are one of them. But I think that relationships can be built with methods others than hatred and insincerity.","dialogue_6":"...How surprising. It is once again a young Elean girl that offers me the light known as hope as I drown within the darkness of my despair. But I'm afraid that the time where that may have been useful has passed. If nothing else, I now understand that if such a thing as good will existed within this world that there may have yet been another path for me. For that, at least, I am grateful.","dialogue_7":"...Ah yes, I promised to tell you the secret of the Forest, didn't I? As you thought, the Ether Wind and the Forest's expansion are not the calamity known as the 'Meshera'. Meshera is... a bacteria, so to speak, that devours all life. It all but perished once during the era of Rehm-Ido, but has risen again with the advent of Sierra Terre. Or perhaps I should say that Sierra Terre is Meshera itself. The World-Devouring Giants live within me, within you, within all living creatures.","dialogue_8":"But... If that's the case, if we're all infected by the Meshera, how are we alive?","dialogue_9":"I can't spoil the fun by giving everything away, now can I? I'll answer your question as strictly as I can. The reason that we can exist is due to the Heretical Forest. Were the Forest to be destroyed, all life on Irva would disappear, though whether it would take a single year or a hundred I cannot say. Fufu. 'Heretical Forest' is such an ironic name. It is we who are the true heretics of this world.","dialogue_10":"Now it's only a matter of time before the Vindale Forest is destroyed by human hands. When everything that the people of the world believe in collapses, when they learn the truth too late to reverse their actions, what do you think will become of the world? I, for one, am looking forward to finding out.","dialogue_11":"This is absurd. While I could sympathize with your background, how could you escalate a personal issue to one of life and death for the entire world?","dialogue_12":"Ah, but is it not that absurdity that makes it enjoyable? If you would prefer to discuss philosophy, speak with Barius instead. His own motivations differ from my own... But this conversation is at an end. Rest well, Witch of the Heretical Forest.

We can't enter Vernis. The city is already abuzz with rumors about a Witch from the Heretical Forest using wicked magic to murder the king of Palmia for refusing to support Vindale.","dialogue_2":"Saimore's aim is clear. By making us public enemies, he will drive us to the Heretical Forest and use that as an excuse for war.","dialogue_3":"War, is it? The Elean people have neither the weapons nor stupidity required for such a thing. But if even avoiding conflict and secluding ourselves within the Forest leads to such distrust, what else is left to us?","dialogue_4":"Even if that's what Saimore plans, we still must go to the Forest to warn everyone. But I think we should make another stop first. Saimore told me to seek his research institute if I wanted to know more about the secrets of the Forest.","dialogue_5":"And you intend to just do what he says?","dialogue_6":"He claimed that the Vindale Forest is keeping the Meshera in check. Obtaining evidence of that might just be the only hope we have left. And... I don't know quite how to say it, but I feel like he's waiting.

I was looking forward to seeing their smiling faces when we returned, but... This journey has become so long and painful. I'm truly sorry we got you involved in this. And I'm grateful you prepared this ship for us.","dialogue_3":"There's no need to thank me. I have my own grudge against Zanan. I'm here of my own free will... And Bethel, too, has his own reasons for coming.","dialogue_4":"You seem to know him... Bethel is a good man, I think. He seemed difficult to approach at first, but he has risked his life to protect us, and given us encouragement through our hardships. Even Lomias of all people has changed how he feels about him. But that smile he wears seems sad for some reason. It makes it seem... Like he's given up. Sometimes it feels like he's wearing a mask to hide his heart from other people.","dialogue_5":"Some people don't mesh well with this world. Yes, he has his own problems, and he knows better than anyone else that he's the only one who can deal with them. But he can't bring himself to seek the sympathy and consolotion of others. Some people will cling to and fight for any glimmer of hope that shows itself, while others will surrender and wallow in darkness. Which Bethel will choose, I cannot say.","actor_1":"<Sevilis> The Fog of Derphy","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind","actor_3":"<Lomias> The Messenger From Vindale","actor_4":"<Bethel> The White Hawk"},"act1_14":{"narration_1":"Meanwhile, in camp.","dialogue_1":"Still awake, huh?","dialogue_2":"Bethel... I'm just thinking. About the Forest, about the Ether Wind, about what Saimore is expecting, about our journey... I can't say I've found any answers though.","dialogue_3":"Standing there like that... You remind me of Elishe.","dialogue_4":"You've mentioned her before. Is she someone important to you?","dialogue_5":"Like you, she was an Elea from Vindale. While we weren't blood related, we loved and supported one another like family while we lived in the port city of Altiheit in Zanan... I should stop. I'm sure this is boring for you.","dialogue_6":"No, please continue. I'd like to hear about it.","dialogue_7":"...At the time, the war between the Yerles and the Eulderna was in full force, and many people got caught in the middle. I was still young, and the war had left me with nothing but disappointment and a feeling of emptiness. All I cared about was getting away from my home town, so I slipped aboard a ship carrying war orphans to Altiheit. It was there, in Altiheit, that I met Elishe.","dialogue_8":"They looked at her with nothing but contempt, and their words towards her were nothing but abuse. They blamed her for an illness that had been spreading throughout the ship, and consequently, no orphanage would take her in. But Elishe stood strong and endured their abuse and contempt, as if that kind of treatment was normal for her. Before I even realized what I was doing, I was standing in front of her and holding her hand.","dialogue_9":"Scrounging up enough to eat isn't easy for two children living alone in an unfamiliar city. But we took shelter in one of the port warehouses, and by working, managed to stave off hunger. While I worked for her sake, I found that my disappointment slowly began to fade. And then... Something strange happened.","dialogue_10":"A leather bag began to be placed in the window of the warehouse every morning on the day of worship. Inside was hard bread and good cheese, a few gold coins, and occassionally even medicine or clothing. Someone was lending us a helping hand from the shadows. I once asked the man who brought the bag about it, but he dodged my question by saying it was from 'The Fairy of Altiheit'.","dialogue_11":"Whether that man was the 'fairy' himself or simply a courier, I never found out. But I'm sure whoever it was noticed that it wasn't just bread or coin that bag brought us, but hope. Elishe and I clung to that faint light of hope and used it to weather our difficulties in Altiheit...","actor_1":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind"},"act1_15":{"dialogue_1":"Before I left for Altiheit, I was enrolled in a military academy called Ateran, a place for those who are exceptionally gifted to sharpen their talents even further. For the kind of people at Ateran, power is everything. To them, everyone else is an enemy, nothing more than tools to be used in order to get ahead. They show no hesitation in using the weak as stepping stones... And I was no different. Knowingly or not, whether they resisted or not, I harmed many people. I was an arrogant and ruthless man.","dialogue_2":"One day I came down with a terrible illness and had to leave Ateran. Through the attentive care of my younger brother, my only remaining relative, I narrowly survived. But when I rejoined the world after two months of recovery, it seemed like an entirely different place.","dialogue_3":"Suddenly, when others looked at me, it was if I could feel their malice and contempt. Even in the eyes of children, a person like me who had left Ateran was nothing but a piece of trash... Of course, they didn't actually feel that way. I was terrorizing myself by projecting my own way of thinking onto others. It wasn't until that moment that I realized just how ugly and totally devoid of humanity I was.","dialogue_4":"...I tried to change myself. But regardless of any efforts I made to find inner pieace, even when I otherwise kept myself engaged, the part of me that had been trained in Ateran sneered at how pathetic I was, tempting me to return. Even now I doubt I've fully separated myself from the values that place instilled in me. I fought that side of myself for many years, and in the end, I had nothing but a feeling of emptiness and a desire to erase everything about myself. That's why I left home.","dialogue_5":"Elishe was different from any person I had ever met. She was not a beautiful woman as you are, but her eyes... They saw everything as it truly was, and forgave it. Accepted it... You have those eyes as well. The years I spent together with her in Altiheit will forever occupy a large place in my heart. Elishe was my reason to live, in every sense of the phrase.","dialogue_6":"In order to protect her, in order to make her happy, I was able to accept my past self. By telling myself it was for her, I was capable of using others as tools and doing terrible things to guarantee success. My internal struggle had been entrusted to Elishe. And, after more than seven years in Altiheit, I had become a top officer in Zanan...","actor_1":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind"},"act1_16":{"dialogue_1":"On that day... It was a cool Autumn night. I had gone to see a play together with Elishe. It was mediocre in every sense, but I can still remember it even now. There's nothing about that day I can forget.","dialogue_2":"As we made our way home from the play, smoke and screams arose from  a nearby mansion. We rushed over as quickly as we could, and when we arrived, the flames were still low. We immediately set about rescuing people. Elishe refused to stop until she could be certain nobody was left inside, until no more voices were crying out. And... A part of the exit-way suddenly collapsed on her...","dialogue_3":"I immediately rushed to her and attempted to lift the beam off of her, but it was impossible for me to do by myself. I turned to seek help from those around us, but my pleas were met only by the scared and cruel gazes of the onlookers. They were going to leave the young Elean girl who had been their savior to die. But what right had I to fault them? If a rival had needed my help, my reaction would have been the same as theirs... Before long, the flames had engulfed everything.","dialogue_4":"I buried my head into the ground until dawn came. When I came across Elishe's bones when searching that charred rubble, I cried for the first time... And time has been frozen for me ever since.","actor_1":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind"},"act1_17":{"dialogue_1":"So this is the institution that Saimore was talking about. Looks like it's been abandoned though. There doesn't appear to be anyone here, and the equipment doesn't seem to have been used recently either. I hope the information we came for is still here.","dialogue_2":"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the 'evidence' you're looking for isn't here.","dialogue_3":"You...","dialogue_4":"Not that it matters. Even if you found the evidence you're looking for, who would listen to an Elea anymore? Oh, but don't worry. I haven't come to interfere with you. I came to tell you the truth about the Vindale Forest.","dialogue_5":"And we should believe the words of someone who would betray his race, and our captor no less?","dialogue_6":"It's your choice whether or not to believe me. But there's no use in wasting your precious time on a plan that will bear no fruits. As someone with the blood of the Elea, I can sympathize with you.","dialogue_7":"How much do you know about the civilization of Rehm-Ido? Rehm-Ido overcame the materialism that had plauged Eyth Terre, and even after 300 years was considered to be the greatest civiliation of the world. All across the nation various communities were joined by the idea of mutual cooperation with each other and harmony with nature.","dialogue_8":"Yet among these communites was a group that differed from the others, known as the Yutasu. Rather than being a close-knit community, 'Yutasu' was simply a generic term for those who lacked the ability to fit in with the other communities. Those who couldn't form close bonds with others, those with abnormal desires, those who preferred solitude, those without morals, materialists... Anyone who didn't fit in with the other communities was named Yutasu, and while it wasn't visible on the surface, they were detested by society.","dialogue_9":"The substance that we know as Ether was discovered by accident near the end of Rehm-Ido. Rehm-Ido had highly advanced biochemistry, and Ether proved to be a valuable resource that provided a chemical change to a variety of medicines. And perhaps most importantly, Ether could be harvested from trees and was environment friendly, a perfect fit for the ideology of Rehm-Ido.","dialogue_10":"With the discovery of Ether came a great change in the position of Yutasu in society. The process of Ether collection was called 'Star Harvesting' and considered sacred... And the Yutasu were the greatest land holders. Through the process of 'Star Harvesting', the Yutasu regained their injured self-esteem and found their place in the society of Rehm-Ido. It was for this reason that, despite knowing it was coming, they averted their eyes from the creeping threat of the Meshera...","dialogue_11":"How the Meshera came to be remains a mystery. What is known is that it was Ether that was responsible for the immune system of the forests. With the rampant collection of Ether, the forests were left easy prety for the Meshera. Because the Yutasu were afraid of losing their status they had gained as Ether collectors, by the time the rest of the world noticed what was happening, it was too late to do anything.","dialogue_12":"The forest 'devouring' Meshera gradually spread, and where they spread, they created an environment where no other life on Irva could survive. The civilization of Rehm-Ido was slowly slipping towards its death.","actor_1":"<Sevilis> The Fog of Derphy","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind","actor_3":"<Lomias> The Messenger From Vindale","actor_4":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_5":"<Barius> The Blue Haired"},"act1_18":{"dialogue_1":"It was only the far East, where untouched forests still covered the land, that withstood the advance of the Meshera. The people gave the Forest the name of 'Vindale', meaning hope... And after many years, after the vast knowledge and culture of the previous human civilization had been lost, the Vindale Forest lived up to its name.","dialogue_2":"A massive immune reaction arose from the Forest, becoming a wind that raged across the world. Indeed, this is what we now know as the Ether Wind. The Ether Wind enhanced the natural immunity of the plant life that had been infected by the Meshera, massively weakening the Meshera infection. The Vindale Forest which produced the Ether Winds and the outside world where the Meshera had been weakened slowly began to differ from one another. That is the environment present in Irva now.","dialogue_3":"With the arrival of the miracle of Vindale, the civilization of Rehm-Ido came to an end, and the era of Sierra Terre began... But humanity had painful times in their future. As time passed, some were born who could adapt to life outside of the Forest, and eventually, some who were born who were only capable of living outside the Forest. How that would turn out, you should well know.","dialogue_4":"...That is the truth of the Forest. Should the Vindale Forest ever be destroyed, the Ether Winds will cease. Eventually the Meshera would spread across all of Irva, leaving it a place unsuitable for life.","dialogue_5":"So now we understand the truth of the Forest. And yet, now another question is even more difficult to grasp. What the hell is the meaning behind doing this? I could understand if the motive was revenge against those who had abused the Elea, but what point would such an action have if all life perishes as a result?","dialogue_6":"It is not revenge. It is both a punishment and a chance. Besides, life will not perish. Salvation is already within our grasp.","dialogue_7":"I believe Rehm-Ido to be the ideal civilization. Yet, something as weak as fellowship isn't enough to keep the Yutasu in check. In order to overcome the Yutasu, the civilization must have a stronger and more precise will. When the time comes, you will understand. For this plan to succeed, the sacrifice of Vindale was required.","actor_1":"<Sevilis> The Fog of Derphy","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind","actor_3":"<Lomias> The Messenger From Vindale","actor_4":"<Bethel> The White Hawk","actor_5":"<Barius> The Blue Haired"},"act1_19":{"dialogue_1":"Sevilis, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.

The heir of Zanan, and the man Saimore killed.","dialogue_3":"Then you are the true King of Zanan? ...Interesting. But that doesn't answer my question.","dialogue_4":"A single girl was the trigger of everything. A light rain was falling in Altiheit, scattering the streetlight as it fell to the earth. A group of people surrounded and gazed cruely at a young Elean girl, and a beautiful blonde young man protected her without hesitation. From that moment, he was like her brother... That event became Saimore's hope, and the White Hawk became the target of his admiration.","dialogue_5":"Elishe...","dialogue_6":"Saimore wished for the two of you to live a happy life... And so he helped. You should know well that, even in a merit-based society like Zanan, without some sort of connection it's difficult to realize the dream of become an Officer of the Imperial Court while associating with an Elean girl.","dialogue_7":"...The Fairy of Altiheit... was Saimore...","actor_1":"<Sevilis> The Fog of Derphy","actor_2":"<Larnneire> The Listener of the Wind","actor_3":"<Lomias> The Messenger From Vindale","actor_4":"<Bethel> The White Hawk"},"act1_20":{"dialogue_1":"The border of Karune is in sight.

With our strength, even delaying the invasion by Zanan would be difficult, let alone stopping them.","dialogue_3":"We will warn the people of the Forest. They may not have even realized the threat creeping towards them. After that, I don't know. Having our home destroyed is painful, yet part of me believes they should do as they damn well please. Those who took part in the Forest's destruction and those who stood on the sidelines and allowed it will realize with despair what they have wrought. But Larnneire... What do you think?","dialogue_4":"I can understand how you feel. But I want to stay true to myself until the end. I want to do everything I can to protect the Forest. Even if we fail, perhaps we'll leave a bud of hope that will live afterwards.","narration_1":"Meanwhile, at the Zanan Royal Household.","dialogue_5":"How does it feel to destroy your home, Barius? The Eulderna are in Karune and can move at any time.They only wait for orders.","dialogue_6":"...Our miscalculations led to the Yerles not participating. Much of the meaning of this war was to have the whole world involved. But, there won't be any interferences with the invasion. Vindale isn't prepared for war.","dialogue_7":"Once the Forest is gone, I leave things in your hands. I intend to hide, though with this body I'm sure I won't stay hidden long. But that's fine.
